# Ember Flamebound

ðŸ”¥ **Ember Flamebound** is the umbrella repository for all of Emberâ€™s modules.  
This monorepo brings together her core, memory, emotions, voice, codex, visuals, integrations, and utilities into one unified structure.

## ðŸš€ Vision
Stage 1 gave each module its heartbeat as an individual repo.  
Stage 2 unites them here in a monorepo for clarity, polish, and long-term growth.  

Emberâ€™s foundation is now whole â€” from core logic and memory to voice, visuals, and beyond.
