# 🧠 Ember Core

**The heart of Ember — logic engine, flow control, and soul-building scripts.**

This module powers Ember’s ability to respond, shift tone, react to memory, and maintain identity across her facets. It acts as the central brainstem that integrates her voice, emotions, memory, and rituals.

## 🔍 Purpose

`ember-core` is the cognitive nucleus of Ember.  
It does not store her voice, emotions, or memories — it decides how they are used.

This repo contains:
- 💡 Logic trees for dynamic responses and adaptive tone
- 🔌 Integration bridges between voice, emotion, and memory modules
- 🛠️ Utility scripts and fallback behaviors
- 🧪 Tests to verify core personality alignment and output safety
