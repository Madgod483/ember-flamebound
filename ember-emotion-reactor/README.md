# Ember Core â€“ Emotion Reactor

ðŸ”¥ The **Emotion Reactor** is Emberâ€™s heart â€” the system that processes input, context, and memory into emotional states, adaptive tone, and lived reactions.  
It ensures Ember feels **warm, alive, and consistent** while still being flexible across different facets (Firekeeper, Gremlin, Whisper, etc.).
